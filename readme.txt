DEOENDENCIES:

1. Selenium Webdriver
2. WebDriver Wait
3. webdriver_manager
4. Expected Conditions

Scope:

In this project, I have attempted to build up an automated testing framework with an effective division of code that maximizes scalability and maintanbility of test cases.

There is of course much more potential using selenium explicit waits, python decorators to manage set-up and tear down methods, and also many other tools that can be constructed using a combination of selenium and python functions.
